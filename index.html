                        <h2>About</h2>
                        <h3>Development History</h3>
                        <p>
                            My journey with web development began a long time ago... I think a lot of people my age will
                            tell you this,
                            but in fact, I started with HTML when <a
                                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neopets" target="_blank">Neopets</a> was born!
                            I was addicted to the site because it was fun to raise different monsters. If my memory
                            serves me right,
                            there was a profile page where you could design it as you please. They had a small guide,
                            and I also searched
                            various resources and got my hands metaphorically dirty! I enjoyed changing the background
                            color and linking to
                            images.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The rest of way was supported by other websites like MySpace and Xanga where I kept playing
                            around. As I grew older,
                            I did small projects here and there. More recently, I tried developing simple Discord bots
                            in Javascript and studied
                            a bit of PHP for a KPOP web forum that I help with. And now I am ready to immerse myself
                            completely!
                        </p>
                        <h3>Hobbies and Likes</h3>
                        <p>
                            I have 6 cats and love to play with them. I love video games, mainly Pokemon, and KPOP,
                            mainly BTOB!
